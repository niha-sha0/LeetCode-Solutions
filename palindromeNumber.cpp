Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
  
Solution : 

bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        long int rev = 0;
        int temp, fun = x;
        if(x < 0)
            return false;
        while(x != 0)
        {
            temp = x % 10;
            rev = rev * 10 + temp;
            x = x / 10;
        }
        return fun == rev;
    }
